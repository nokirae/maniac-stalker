# Maniac-Stalker Fabric mod (Minecraft 1.21.7+)
The mod is designed to process and display data received from the server about players (usually from TAB).

Thus, this mod can be useful for:
- Administrators and developers who want to check the UUID, ping, and game mode of players;
- Players who are being stalked in the game can now track silent entry/exit, game mode, and everyone who is currently nearby.

The mod includes the following commands:
- <code>/ms ping [player]</code> - Displays the ping of all or a target;
- <code>/ms check</code> - Displays and compares the number of players on the server and nearby;
- <code>/ms near</code> - Displays everyone nearby;
- <code>/ms list</code> - Displays information about players (UUID, ping, game mode);
- <code>/ms toggle [module]</code> - Switches all or the specified tracking module (joinleave, gamemode, near);
- <code>/ms uwu</code> - A humorous command to search for femboys and tomboys on the server (works better if DisplayName() contains a gender symbol (e.g. from the HuGender plugin)).

If you want to make changes, please fork the repository (pull request if important), as this repository will be archived in the future and its development will be discontinued.
